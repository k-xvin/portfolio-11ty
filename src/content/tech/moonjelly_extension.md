This was a hackathon submission for Ocean Protocol's Data Economy Challenge 2020. It's a little chrome extension that let's you browse, upload, and set notifications on things in the Ocean Data Marketplace. 

Jeremy and I wanted to challenge ourselves by diving into something we knew very little about, and this idea was further expanded upon with [Hark](/tech/harktv-a-retrospective).

This is also the second hackathon of the triple hackathon streak Jeremy and I went on: [Node Visualizer](/tech/node-visualizer/) -> [Moonjelly](/tech/moonjelly-chrome-extension/) -> [Hark](/tech/harktv-a-retrospective).
