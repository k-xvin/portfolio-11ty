# Longboards
My friend had an idea to make longboards in his garage. I joined him in this project since I liked making things. Neither of us knew how to ride a longboard, but we had the internet and we had the woodworking tools. 

Since making these though, I've become an avid longboarder, and it's been a primary form of travel for me around university and in general.

We made about 5 different longboards, and sold a few to some other friends.

# The Process
<div picture-grid="2">

{% image "./src/img/posts/longboards/press.jpg", "longboard press real" %}

</div>

The gist of building a longboard from scratch goes something like this:
1. Acquire wood 
    * We used 1/8 inch baltic birch plywood
2. Cut wood into longboard-sized sheets
3. Glue sheets together, alternating the wood grain (for strength)
4. Dry the glue and wood sheet stack while applying pressure to it
    * This gives the longboard deck its "bend"
    * You will want to make a contraption to hold the sheets in the right shape while it dries--a longboard press (see above)
5. Once dry, cut and shape the pressed wood into a longboard looking shape
6. Sand all the surfaces smooth
7. Paint the back of the deck as you see fit and dry
8. Drill the holes for the trucks/wheels
9. Apply 3-4 coats of polyurethane to the whole board and dry
    * This will ensure durability and waterproofing
11. Apply the grip tape to the top of the board
12. Mount the trucks
13. You are done!

# Closing thoughts
* More details can be found in our Google Docs [engineering journal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n-WTzYEHHpv0-lnIUWKVuDNsl-4a_Rr5jMzaDWa7HHw/edit?usp=sharing).
* This is one of my favorite projects, mostly because I'm still using the longboard!
* The total material cost for 1 longboard was about $60.00
    * The majority of the cost were the trucks/wheels -- $35!
* 3 years later, the board is still in pretty good condition. 
    * I swapped out the wheels for those wavy shark wheels--they're not that different from normal wheels.
    * Picture below.
