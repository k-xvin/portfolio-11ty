# Browser Extension

I recently found the website [freecrosswordpuzzles.com.au](https://freecrosswordpuzzles.com.au/). It's a pretty old website, but it's got a heck of a lot of free crosswords on it.

However, the crossword interface lacks some keyboard navigation options. Unlike the New York Times crosswords, you can't press (shift) + tab/enter to move forward a clue (or backward) a clue. The lack of this feature made filling out the board a little painful.

On a whim, I whipped together a browser extension to add tab/enter key navigation to the site, and it works good enough. I made the icon for the extension using Hundred Rabbits' [Dotgrid](https://100r.co/site/dotgrid.html) tool.

This was a nice little project I spent a few days on (coding + uploading it to Firefox/Chrome).
