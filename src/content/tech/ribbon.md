This was a submission for [HackUCI 2021](https://hackuci-2021.devpost.com/), made with my roommates.

It's a website/app that analyzes group chat messages and spits out a little title about everyone in the chat (who sent the most pictures, most messages, etc). In essence, it's a Spotify-wrapped-esque experience, but for a group chat.

We only had about 24 hours to do this one, and we spent a lot of time just trying to come up with an idea. Once we did come up with an idea, it was a scramble to try and have something finished in time.
