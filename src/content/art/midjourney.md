# Midjourney
All images were generated using [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), through a free trial on their public Discord server.

I started with the prompt `flat encyclopedia drawing of the earth with style of beksinski in sepia and red`.
<div picture-grid>
<img src="/img/posts/midjourney/g_un_flat_encyclopedia_drawing_of_the_earth_with_style_of_beksi_21d30355-3b71-48cd-a2e8-a5633c1ac2b2.png"/>

</div> 

This one is `beksinski landscape, 3d render, volumetric lighting, bright colors`.

I tried `zarbobo`, just to see what would come out.

And this is one I happened to see in the Discord that I thought looked nice. The prompt was `bliss`.

There's definitely some strange artifacting here and there in all the drawings if you look closely, but overall these are some really impressive results.
