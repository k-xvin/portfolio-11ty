# Generative Art
I've been making generative art for a while now. I've used p5js (javascript), Nannou (Rust), and OpenRNDR (Kotlin). Nannou is great for high-performance programs, but p5js wins out on convenience. OpenRNDR has some nice recording features built in.

The art below is updated occasionally. Many of these have been written and displayed [on OpenProcessing.](https://openprocessing.org/user/270923?o=25&view=sketches)
