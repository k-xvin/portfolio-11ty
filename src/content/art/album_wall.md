# Album Wall
Empty walls call for art. Albums were selected between my roommates and I. One of them also made a handy Venn diagram for who chose which albums (shown below). 

We ordered the prints on 8" by 8" foamboard [from printmoz](https://www.printmoz.com/). The price was very reasonable (about $3-4 per album cover print), and the quality was also fantastic. The colors came out just right, with no blurriness or pixelation either.
