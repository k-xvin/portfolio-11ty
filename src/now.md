# August 2022
* I've been working on this dang website. Just switched from using Nuxt to 11ty, since I figured a pure static site served my needs better. Plus there's a better content management system here for blogs and posts.
* Been trying to make some generative art everyday, but it's more like every weekend.
* Looking into making physical prints of my art. Maybe risographs? Plotter pictures?
* Final year of college starting up. The future is uncertain.
